      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p1>Hey there! I'm Zainab Baig, a determined university student currently in my 3rd year of pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science (ICS) degree. Born and brought up in Pakistan, I had the incredible opportunity to complete my high schooling and undergraduate education in Canada at Queen's University, where I majored in Life Science. However, my passion for technology and the desire to make a meaningful impact led me to an exciting new pathâ€”I'm thrilled to be starting my Bachelor of Computer Science journey in September 2023.
